        <p>The wedding was a whirlwind. For all the stress that weddings are supposed to bring, the day was just perfect. The bride was perfect, so everything was perfect.

          We left early the next morning for an immediate honeymoon, flying from deep evergreen forests in Washington to the Mediterranean waters of Greece. We were heading toward the Greek island of Crete, then Athens. 
          
          We love finding new places, learning and thinking out loud over drinks about everything we hear and see. 
          
          We got a small room on the Venetian harbor of Chania. Our bedroom balcony was a great people watching spot, over red wine at sunset. The room, in a five-room boutique hotel, was filled with white molding, even a couple marble busts. A wrought iron balcony overlooked the harbor – a wide, circular stone harbor lined with restaurants and outdoor dining. The harbor stayed alive with parties late into each night. 
          
          Moussaka was the official dish of the trip. Raki was the official drink. We definitely bought into all the touristy stuff along the way. The food and drinks are just too damn good to ignore. But we did meet a bartender who was enthusiastic for us to try some IPAs local to Greece.
          
          We’ve both spent many years living in tourist mountain towns, so we recognize the dance of tourists and locals. The awe of beautiful landscapes, the struggle of remote living and scramble of people flooding in like waves.

        <h1> 1. Heatwave </h1>

  <p>
  
    At the beginning of our travel, Europe was enduring an excruciating heatwave. Wildfires blazed across parts of Greece, north of where we were staying in Athens.

    But London was particularly unprepared for the onslaught of heat. It was the hottest day in English history.
    
    Even thinking of mass travel makes me break out in a sweat. Airport security, the squished-full airplane cabins, the underground, bustling stations of various sorts, any point of congestion along this human centipede of modern travel.
    
    Trains can be quite nice.
    
    On the London underground, we’re squeezed in, with all our belongings, into a boiling steel tube, touching the sticky hot-cold flesh of strangers. We are steeped among people in all manner of dress, and personal hygiene standards. Not that I have much room to talk. I am sweating buckets, thanks as much to my medication as the heat. But even more of a problem, I look like someone who is intensely nervous to be stuck on this train – which of course I am. But I think it’s also making other people nervous.
    
    Like, why is this guy so fucking nervous? What’s he got to hide?
    
    I squirm with discomfort much of the way, but the destination is always worth it if you keep your eyes open. And of course, where else is there to move except forward?

        <h1> 2. Chania, on the Island of Crete </h1>

  <p>
    Greece and Crete were also sweltering, but sea breezes dampened the effect.

In Chania, (that’s pronounced “Ha-nia”), Crete, there’s a wonderful Europe-meets-Middle East, Mediterranean culture  surrounded by aqua-marine sea, brilliantly clear blue water.

Chania, like much of Greece, is a culture of layers built on and into preceding layers. Layers from early Cretan cultures, layers from the Greeks, from the Turks, the Venetians, right up to the modern graffiti covered walls.  

A maritime museum in Chania depicts the many, many conquests of this island. The Nazi occupation caught my attention, and the local resistance still proudly memorialized in its own section of the museum.

Among all this evidence of countless lives spent, the waves of changing hands.

        <h1>3. Pickpockets</h1>

        <p>
        
          At the scenic harbor in Chania, a tall, dark-skinned Greek man, probably in his 50s, sat cross-legged next to the harbor water, throwing a toy, a rubber sticky ball, onto a small square platform. He scans the passing crowd. Watching for four nights in a row, we begin to realize his perfect timing for catching the eye of passing children.

We watch a pair of small dark-skinned boys playing hand drums for tourists sitting by the water. 

We soon got the feeling that they would also lift anything made readily available, if you didn’t keep your wits about you.

The restaurant hosts along the sea-misted harbor walk would sometimes have a harsh word, sometimes negotiate, with the boys and girls.

This seems like a common cat and mouse, as I watched a waitress in the ally throw something and hiss at a gaggle of vagrant children that had been at the hem of her dress. One host breaks into a full run to catch a pair of the children. A small girl just barely escapes his grasp, and as she runs, she turns to flip him the bird. “Fuck you!” she shouts over her shoulder, youthful glee bounding in each step.

Around a corner, just on the other side of the harbor walls, a woman sits in a wheelchair, grumbling and shouting at a group of the children. They help one another wrap bandages on what looked like healthy wrists. But who could know for sure? Is this the queenpin of the harbor children rebuking them for not bringing in enough money? She sure gives them an earful.

          Everywhere we go, hosts and servers insist, “You need a sweet.” It was definitely not a question, and we accept, of course. 

          The lodging staff at both locations were also always eager to inquire into our plans for each day, so every outing winds up feeling a bit like sneaking out without arousing a parent. Even the people being paid to care seem to care more than they must.
          
          When we leave the hotel, they repeatedly advise that we “take a right.” “Definitely do not take a left,” is never quite said but seems implied.

          <h1> 5. Athenian anarchy </h1>

          <p>
            Angsty anarchist culture overwhelms the Athenian streets. Downtown Athens almost felt just like home, coming from Seattle, with even more overt anarchism. Graffiti covers the bottoms of downtown buildings, anywhere close enough for an arm to reach with a spray paint can.

            Lots of anarchy symbols, the encircled “A,” marked walls in spray paint. Some artists go much higher, and their images tower overhead, across entire buildings. One portrait of <a href="ino.net">a woman wearing a black balaklava</a> casts an ominous aura over the streets.
            
            Sprinkled throughout the city are buildings or properties that are utterly destitute, slowly collapsing.
            
            The economic austerity endured by the region is fresh in mind. We briefly pass a protest of austerity measures at the Parliament Building, the event completely hemmed in by police in tactical gear and confined to a quarter block.

          <p>
          
            At about 5:30 a.m., around a dark corner of the alleyway, we find the white thrusting buttocks of a man, straddled by a woman sitting on a fine rugmaker’s table.

            “Oh-ma-god!” my wife says, and in our shock we hustle to turn around and take a different path, giving them plenty of room for the privacy they didn’t seem to need. We laugh on our merry way.
            
            “The summer of love indeed!” I say.
            
            “As long as that was consensual,” my wife says. We continue our walk, awkwardly second-guessing ourselves.

            <p>
              I’m a sucker for traditional knick knacks, so worry beads were a no brainer for me. 
              “These are for praying,” the shopkeeper said, running his hands over the rosaries. 
              “These are for playing” as he indicates the worry beads.
              
              He pulled out a hand-written note (in blue ballpoint Bic, I’d say) and listed off the beads’ numerous medicinal, psychological, and spiritual benefits. He tells about how his wife, smiling behind the counter, makes all of these by hand. Of course, that’s just stringing beads with pieces of thread, but only an asshole would point this out.
              
              “Also, to help avoid smoking,” the old man says, waving his hand in the motion of flipping the beads.

          <h1> 8. Warrior wrath</h1>

        <p>
          At the base of the Acropolis, an ancient Greek warrior presents his weapons to a happily amused family outside the acropolis. He announces his title and heritage. He instructs the family in the foundations of a strong spear throw, his eyes with passion in the sweltering heat. 

          Then the warrior shouts at me to stop photographing them. “This is a family photo, can’t you tell?”
          
          I am confused, but compliant. We move along, not wanting to provoke the soldier’s wrath.

  <h1> 9. Acropolis awe</h1>            
<p>
  An older British woman takes in the ruins with a deep breath as she mounts to stairs.
  “Well, this fucking shit ain’t worth 20 euros,” she says. 
  
  We are astounded, but we also can’t help being amused. It seems an enduring truth of humanity, no matter what wonders of the world you discover, at the ends of the Earth standing before true majesty, you’ll find some unimpressed and ungrateful sad sack.

<h1> 10. Cretan Rock'n Roll</h1>
<p>
  We took a tour bus winding through the Cretan mountains on the west side of the island, traversing the mountain crest corridor filled with olive groves, the guide turned on traditional Cretan music and told us stories of extravagant Cretan weddings in these mountains, weddings that run through the night and through the whole next day. She put on some traditional Cretan music, of vigorous violin and stringed instruments rolling through a festive but antiquated tune.

  This old British guy on the bus gets agitated and says, “Hey, this music is driving me crazy. Can you put on something else, like rock’n roll?”
  
  She looks at him kind of dumbfounded. 

  <br>
  
  “But you’re in Crete,” she says.
  
  “Yeah, but you got any rock’n roll up there?”
  
  “Ah, this is Cretan rock’n roll,” she says.

                <h1> Looking forward by looking at now </h1>

<p>

  We may have just gotten married, but we’re coming up on ten years together.
  We keep wondering; always hungry to know and see.
  
  Our brightest moments are those of just being silly, having fun with simple things. And that’s quite easy when your person can make an entire event out of just being stuck together.
  
  The future is forever uncertain. So onward we go, together.
