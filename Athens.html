<h1>Love, from Athens</h1>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>For our honeymoon, we spent a couple weeks on the Greek island of Crete, and then in Athens. The wedding was as much of a whirlwind as they all said it would be, and such a surge of happiness I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for. We spend much of our honeymoon oo-ing and ah-ing over Greek foods and wines and sunsets. Travel is an exercise in channelling deep inner calm. Especially at and around the airport, the underground. Trains can be quite nice. Europe is in the middle of a heatwave. The London underground squeezes us in, with all our belongings, into a boiling steel tube with the sticky hot-cold flesh of strangers. We are steeped among people in all manner of dress, and all manner of cleanliness. I am sweating like a stuck hog, thanks largely to my medication. I squirm in the utmost discomfort and anxiety through much of this experience, but I tell myself the destinations are worth it. So we haven&rsquo;t stopped yet. When she&rsquo;s there I get to lean on my wife&rsquo;s exceptional travel coordination.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>In Greece we find angst anarchist punk culture. In downtown Athens we found a scene that in many ways reminded of Seattle. Graffiti covers the walls, the bottom walls of the downtown streets, anywhere close enough for an arm to reach. And some, clearly with the means to go much higher, have their images looming large overhead, across entire buildings. The island life, the tourist economy, complete with all the features familiar to those who have lived in them. Chania is built in layers of geology and of culture. Layers of early Cretean cultures, layers from the Greeks, the Turks, Venetians, right up to the modern graffiti covering the walls. The waves of changing hands, feel haunting in these times of political turmoil in America. We were overwhelmed by our privilege, watching the lives of people from our balcony at sunset. We remembered our own lives and work in tourist towns &ndash; the beauty, the struggle, the impact of people rising like the waves of a flood. We talk a lot about what it means to be one of the drops in that flood. Anarchist vibe, lots of political angst that we try to better understand. Many anarchy symbols, the encircled &ldquo;A,&rdquo; are marked in spray paint on building walls. We talk a lot over our dinners about the ethics of travel, and tourism. So many of the same old gripes from our days living in Colorado tourist towns, but we try to live with our eyes open about our impact, as much as possible. An older Brittish woman takes in the ruins with a deep breath as she mounts to stairs. &ldquo;Well, this fucking shit ain&rsquo;t worth 20 euros,&rdquo; she says. We are astounded, but we also can&rsquo;t help being superbly amused. It seems an enduring truth of humanity, no matter what wonders of the world you discover, at the ends of the Earth standing before true majesty, you&rsquo;ll find some unimpressed and ungrateful complaining sad sack. Well, keep them in the cities at least. The truth hurts, but it opens one&rsquo;s eyes. Wine on a bedroom balcony overlooking the Venetian harbor. A man, probably in his 50s, sits cross-legged on the ground, throwing rubber sticky balls onto a small square platform. He scans the passing crowd. Watching for four nights in a row, we begin to realize his perfect timing for catching the eye of passing children.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>What&rsquo;s next, we keep wondering? This ancient Greek warrior presents his weapons to a doting family outside the acropolis. He announces his . His eyes gleam with passion in the sweltering Athenian heat, when he shouts at me to stop photographing them. &ldquo;This is a family photo, can&rsquo;t you tell?&rdquo; I am confused, but compliant. So we move along, not wanting to provoke the wrath of an elite soldier. Everywhere we go, we find, of course, many generous people. Many kind and hospitable people. Uh, sometimes a little too attentive to our needs. But who can be grumpy with this? Is it just the tourism economy, maybe all just a commercial attraction to amuse and sell entertainment to wealthy people? And the beauty of capitalism, I suppose, is that you get it all for the price of the ticket, and no one is forcing you to think about these things. Well, even the people being paid to care seem to care more than they must by their employer. The economic austerity the region has endured is still fresh and in the back of everyone&rsquo;s minds. We briefly pass a protest of austerity measures at the Parliament Building, the event completely hemmed in by tactical geared police and confined . We watch a pair of small dark-skinned boys playing hand drums for tourists who were sitting by the water in the scenic harbor. The restaurant host would sometimes have a harsh word, sometimes negotiate, but always finally resorting to chasing the boys and girls away. This seems like a common cat and mouse, as the . We see one little girl flip him the bird and yell, &ldquo;Fuck you!&rdquo; We start to get the sense that these children would lift anything you made available, if you weren&rsquo;t keeping your wits about you. Around a corner, just on the other side of the harbor walls, a woman sits in a wheelchair, grumbling and shouting at a group of the children. They help one another wrap bandages on what looked like healthy wrists. But who could know for sure? Is this the queenpin of the harbor children rebuking them for not bringing in enough money? Earning an income Surviving in these ways, I&rsquo;m sure you must keep many avenues earning an income open, and ready to be readily taken advantage of. Who could envy or blame them? We wonder about their lives. The life of a Cretan begging child. At about 5:30 a.m., around a dark morning corner of the alleyway we find the white thrusting buttocks of a man, straddled by a woman sitting on a fine rugmaker&rsquo;s table. &ldquo;Oh ma god!&rdquo; my wife says, and we hustle to turn around and take a different path, giving them plenty of room for the decency that they clearly weren&rsquo;t trying too hard for. We laugh on our merry way. &ldquo;As long as that was consensual,&rdquo; my wife says. And I pause to reassess what we had just seen. We draw up plans for the house, plans for our careers. Our conversations are amazing creative spaces, with many interesting questions and lots of curiosity. The future always uncertain, onward we go. For better or for worse, onward.</p>
