      In March 2023 we spent a few days in Buenos Aires, then in Patagonia in the southern tip of Argentina. I had developed a nagging curiosity about Latin America. The whole region felt like a blind spot really, based on my Midwestern education.

      Buenos Aires was busy, vibrant, and crowded. On a building overlooking the heart of BA, a portrait of Eva Peron, historic first-lady of Argentina and labor rights leader, giving a speech, as if to the present-day citizens.
      
      It’s become a common theme in our travels, that we find ourselves exploring a new country while it’s experiencing record-breaking heat (side eye). And this time was no different. In downtown Buenos Aires, fresh paper “Heat warning” signs wilted off of old green (brass?) signposts.

  The concrete block structures of boxy apartment buildings studded the city landscape. The city presents divergent lives living next to one another. A world of squalor and a world of riches.

A big difference we see on these streets, or perhaps it’s just my ignorance, but so many of those living on the streets are families – full family units of moms, dads and two or more kids. They’re sleeping all together on the filthy street, and it strikes me what an individual plight homelessness has always seemed to me. But a whole family, homeless together, felt very different.

Of course there are kids on the street back home too, but it seems like a life circumstance that we largely view as occurring to a person, an individual.

The youth culture reminds me of Athens or Seattle or Portland. The anarchy symbols scrawled everywhere; a brilliant black mustache spray painted, unceremoniously, on a poster of Pope Francis. The city was brimming with progressive culture, and LGBT and trans pride around the city.

Despite the heat, reveling in it really, we found festival dancers expressing memories of grief in beautifully cathartic movements. We found ourselves in the middle of Argentina’s largest city during a massive festival…demonstration…well, it was a memorial really. But not like any I’d seen before.

The dancers were clad in black with highlighted streaks of color across their hair, faces, and bodies. They moved in theatrical coordinated dances, easy at times for the onlooking public to join. The smiles and laughter shared between revelers betrayed a deep shared experience.

    “Impossible!” the driver cried, helpless to get us within a half-dozen blocks from the hotel. My wife vaguely recalled reading about a holiday on this weekend, but we didn’t know anything super specific. We reassured the driver that we were okay to walk. No biggie, we can just hoof it.

We found the downtown so packed with people, there was nothing to do but push our way through the masses to get through. Mental note self: when you wish for a hotel in the middle of everything, you may indeed get it.

Among the densely packed crowds, the smell of street food rises in smoke from vendors' grills. The streets were scattered with debris. One narrow street corridor we shuffled through stank of piss, where men, and at least one woman we saw, were urinating in the small privacy offered by a dumpster.

        This was a mass demonstration of remembrance for those who disappeared under the military dictatorship of Argentina in the 70s and 80s. With such a dark origin, it had become a celebration of the people passed, and the people who remain. Many locals we met along the way were keen to educate us about the 30-some-thousand people who were “disappeared” from Argentina during this period.

It's ever so eerie to be in a nation with such a recent memory of fascist violence.

    The dancers unfurl a blue tapestry checkered with photos of the disappeared. This was their tribute, to ensure we do not forget the names and the faces.

    When they unfurled a tapestry with those faces, the significance came like a heavy blow. We use the word “fascism” a lot in our conversations about nations. How could average Americans really know it? In the Buenos Aires streets that day, it felt impossible to know it like these people did, to understand the fear of fascism the way they do.
    
    The people moved in a mixture of joy and passion, packed in around the obelisk in this vibrant celebration. Racial hatred feels more understood. Resource fighting feels more understood. Religious persecution feels like a known evil. But this fear of pure, authoritarian power is a dark unknown.

     <p>For the second leg of the trip, we flew far south into Patagonia. The mountains were majestic under purple-orange sunsets, and the desert impressed with its wide-open skies – so unlike Buenos Aires. Driving along, the empty but joyous space expanded around us, and I took a long inward breath, not seeing another person around.

      A nearly treeless moonscape of brownish-yellow desert meets aquamarine lakes, elongated nearly fifty miles across: Lago Argentino and Lago Viedma. They meet the jagged heights of legendary mountains of Patagonia – Fitz Roy being the crown peak among them from our position in El Chalten.
      
      In the middle of nowhere, in a deep flat desert around Lago Viedma, we were looking for the small mountain town at the base of Mt. Fitzroy – a massive shark tooth-looking peak. We approached in the night in nearly pure darkness. We saw not a single light on the landscape until we were within a couple miles of the town.

        El Chaltan is homebase for some of the most iconic trekking in the world.

Backpackers and climbers, decked out for the trail, refill on beer at a few restaurants in the tiny mountain refuge. In a one-room, closet of a restaurant, we find a line out the door to sign up for the next day’s waiting list. And the wait is worth it the following day when I get empanadas and a creamy gnocchi.

This tiny town had been in the Argentine news lately, as the home of the country’s vice president, Christina Fernandez Kirchner. Just a few months before she withstood an assassination attempt, and the Argentine news was filled with headlines of corruption investigations. Recently she’s vowed not to run for re-election in the upcoming national election in October 2023.

I knew the economic problems here were troubling, but the realization really sunk in when we found that we couldn’t get any cash from any ATMs. “Is this just something that happens here?” I wondered. Then, after seeing a few Argentines also shocked at the empty ATMs, I started getting a little more nervous myself.

After we’d spent a couple of days hiking and climbing, our guide, Pipa, said that we had been very lucky with the calm weather. We didn’t know at first what he meant, but on the third day the wind did indeed kick up. I can’t imagine doing much of anything outside. The wind, nonstop, hurled small rocks and sand, making for a no-joke projectile danger. We had no idea how lucky we had been.

          El Calafate: Password “Borges”
        </h2>

        <p>  
          In El Calafate we got wine and dessert at a literary themed restaurant in somewhat of a treehouse architecture, with big windows overlooking the main street from the second story. The wifi password was “Borges” – short for the famous Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges (“<a href="https://archive.org/details/TheGardenOfForkingPathsJorgeLuisBorges1941">Garden of Forking Paths</a>”). I came to love him in my college English courses, and his stories of magical realism weaving mystical elements through his literary works. There is some beautiful utility in telling stories of uncanny events.

    I knew they’d be big. But this icy crest of glacier was massive – a deathly jagged wall of skyscraper heights at the edge of miles of icefield bearing down from the mountainside. Its audible cracks and clunks in the depths – they echoed so often, at times every 30 seconds or even faster.

  <h2>A cab ride</h2>
  <p>
    Back in Buenos Aires, on the way to our homebound airplane, our cab driver asks, “What kind of music do you like? Who's your favorite band?”

    We hesitate, then my wife says, "Uh, Metallica…?" He leans forward with a serious expression, gives a couple quick taps on his smartphone, and proclaims, "Okay...Master of Puppets, here we go!" And we jet off through Buenos Aires toward the airport, headbanging and clutching our luggage.
    
    The driver confesses his passion for the football player Messi. A child’s colored drawing of Messi scoring a goal sticks to the roof of his cab, scrawled with “Para papá, con amor.” Of course, he’s not alone. The whole country had looped replays of the World Cup, which they had just won, playing on every pub TV.
    
    He takes a call from a stern faced boss, and chuckles, “Uh-oh. There are troubles,” seeming to let it all roll off his shoulders, and we speed on through the BA traffic. And then he takes a call from a young woman, though it’s unclear if it’s his wife or daughter. “My queen,” he says. 
    
    After too short a trip, we head home with the strong hunch that we’d see this place again.
